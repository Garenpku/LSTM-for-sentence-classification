# LSTM-for-sentence-classification
Different kinds of lstm models for sentence classification.

lstm_skipgram.py: A LSTM model with word embedding generated by the skip-gram model.
---
What you have to modify:

1.data_helper function.

It returns:

  ·`raw_text`, a list of raw sentences.
  
    eg: ['It is a cat.', 'This is your handbag.', 'Coding is wonderful.']
    
  ·`label`, a 2-D matrix of labels corresponding to each sentence, shape = (None, 1)
  
    eg: [[1], [0], [3], [2], [0]]
    
2.`label_set`, the set of all labels, stored in a 2-D matrix.
   
   `eg: label_set = [[0], [1], [2]]`

lstm.py: A LSTM model with pre-trained word vectors.

What you have to modify:

1.`data_helper` function. It's the same as that above.

2.`label_set`. The same as that above.

3.`build_dataset`

  line 68: pre-trained word vector file. Here used vectors trained from wiki corpus.

  line 81-87: Modify it to adapt to the file format.
